# Topic Modeling and T-SNE Visualization 


I have worked on Topic Modeling and T-sne on newsgroup dataset. Here are the different steps which I have done:
 
* Loaded the dataset (newsgroup) this will be used to load any dataset
* Tokenized sentences and converted the sentence into list
* Lemmatize each work in the list
* Build a topic model using LDA topic modeling
* Extracted the most dominant topic from multiple topics
* Most relevant words based on that topic
* Plotted word frequency graph
* Plotted a word cloud of keywords of each topic
* Graph of word count of topic keywords
* Visualization of most discussed topic in dataset
* Visualization using T-sne clustering chart
* Final visualisation using PyLDA on mutiple topics
